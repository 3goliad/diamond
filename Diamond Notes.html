For example, an Azimuthal equidistant projection creates a 2 dimensional map in which all points of the image are at proportionally correct distance from a single center point. You may recognize the Azimuthal equidistant projection from the flag of the United Nations, which coincidentally, serves as a model of Earthly geography endorsed by the flat-earther conspiracy movement–in which a world centered at the pole is concentrically surrounded by a sheer wall of ice. </span><br/></div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/F0D2CE79-021B-44FB-8273-1A88FDA9FE1B.png" height="600" width="600"/><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/600px-Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg.png" height="511" width="600"/><br/></div><div>Most projections of the world (except for those in perspective) are non-Euclidean, and only concerned with two-dimensional representations of the surface of a sphere. <br/></div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/07AE0B36-C396-4FDC-8621-3A0B3AA46AEB.png" height="202" width="800"/><br/></div><div>Geographic coordinates consist of latitude (composed of parallels ) and longitude (composed of meridians). You can easily notice that in-perspective, parallels are latitudinal cuts, and literally parallel, like a series of stacked 2-dimensional circles. <img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/709F861F-1705-4037-8F24-568EEF6F1E16.png" height="340" width="435"/></div><div>Longitudinal cuts, however, intersect with each other at the poles–much like the lines described by stacking an ascending and descending series of sliced pizzas. </div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/imgres%20copy.jpg" height="182" width="277"/><br/></div><div>An Azimuthal projection is non-euclidean because it transforms the surface of the sphere so that the meridians are straight rather than curved–which is highly useful for measuring distance from an arbitrary center point. Although center points are commonly placed at the North Pole, this center point placement is customary, much like the Y-Axis orientation of of the North and South in more conventional map projections, which reflect hierarchies of power through formal geometric relation. Azimuthal projections can be rendered from any point on the globe.</div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/7F86CA74-FDED-4CBE-892B-32595AA1D776.png" height="227" width="222"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>In computer graphics, there is a fundamental technique known as ray tracing, which generates images by tracing paths of light to each pixel. Unlike actual light, which emanates from objects in all directions with our eyes catching some of its rays, ray tracing simply emanates rays from the perspective of the camera, which report back on their points of intersection with objects. Much like map projection, ray tracing involves a means of graphical projection into the second dimension. </div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/D6CA84F5-D01B-474F-BE34-308FA56D8C6D.png" height="188" width="268"/><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/66652DEC-4B06-4FF4-BE56-9E17EF146FAA.png" height="225" width="225"/><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/CE42FE36-4400-4873-A3E2-48464729CB6F.png" height="253" width="511"/><br/></div><div>Ray tracing carries some obvious similarities to map projection, but they often differ because ray tracing is typically projected steographically and thus perspectively, while maps usually are not limited to perspective, preferring instead to show everything at once. . Perspectival maps do exist, however–an example being the azimuthal orthographic projection, which relies on a technique from Antiquity invented by a geographer named Hipparchus. Unlike non-perspetival Azimuthal equidistant projection, Azimuthal  orthographic projection is a perspectival projection of the globe onto a tangent plane. </div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/973D3F96-93C5-4F86-9C0F-1CBE53AFC8F9.png" height="600" width="600"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>The T and O maps of medieval Europe are somewhat similar to Azimuthal orthographic projection. As in all Azimuthal projections, an arbitrary center is assigned–Jerusalem was customary–and the map forms a perfect circle aligned with that center. <br/></div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/F729EA03-DFEF-4000-89A7-5E8E325320B5.png" height="357" width="355"/><br/></div><div>Whether you believe these T and O maps are Azimuthal orthographic or Azimuthal Equidistant depends on whether you think their authors believed the earth was a sphere or a disc–contemporary scholarship aligns with the former, meaning that the T and O map represents only one half the the earth in perspective. </div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/80AFD1C2-B67B-4CA5-BBB5-2CA7EC172E05.png" height="440" width="440"/><br/></div><div>Much like ray-tracing and orthographic projection, photography and human vision deal with the conic intersection of rays at a singular point–whether it be an eye, or a digital camera’s sensor.  A common effect in photography is the use of a fisheye lens, which distorts and magnifies a photograph’s edges. Originally, fisheye lenses involved orthographic projection. </div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/A5C8A8F3-36C7-40D9-A2B5-64F8E02EB4B2.png" height="351" width="440"/><br/></div><div>Before cameras, the fisheye perspective and wide-angle lense was reflected in the panoramic works of renaissance painters of the low-countries, Germany, and Austria. Works like Altdorfer’s <i>The Battle of Alexander at Issus </i>combine a high vantage point with a widened angle of view for a heavenly perspective of events on the surface.</div><div><img src="Diamond%20Notes.resources/DF611118-B456-4690-90DB-57B69919EA08.png" height="580" width="440"/><br/></div><div>Conve</div><div><br/></div></body></html>
